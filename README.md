## Introduction

In today‚Äôs digital landscape, cybersecurity threats are ever-evolving. Honeypots play a crucial role in detecting and mitigating these threats. RAMAPOT simplifies the deployment of multiple honeypots, allowing security professionals to focus on analysis and response rather than setup.

## Features

- **Multi-Honeypot Support**: Deploy Cowrie SSH, Elasticpot, and Redis honeypots.
- **Centralized Logging**: Collect logs from all honeypots in one place.
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Easily deploy and manage honeypots using Kubernetes.
- **Elastic Stack Monitoring**: Utilize Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for monitoring and visualization.
- **User-Friendly Setup**: Simple configuration files for quick deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Cowrie**: A medium interaction SSH honeypot.
- **Elasticpot**: A honeypot that simulates Elasticsearch.
- **Redis Honeypot**: A honeypot that simulates Redis databases.
- **Kubernetes (K3s)**: Lightweight Kubernetes distribution for easy deployment.
- **Elastic Stack**: A set of tools including Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for monitoring and data analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with RAMAPOT, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Kubernetes cluster (K3s recommended).
- Docker installed on your machine.
- Access to a terminal with kubectl configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Glenwestinat/RAMAPOT.git
   cd RAMAPOT
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Docker and Kubernetes set up. Use the following command to build your images:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Deploy the Honeypots**:
   Use the following command to deploy the honeypots on your Kubernetes cluster:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

4. **Access the Dashboard**:
   Once deployed, you can access the Kibana dashboard for monitoring at `http://<your-kibana-url>:5601`.

## Deployment Instructions

Deploying RAMAPOT is straightforward. Follow these steps for a successful setup:

1. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Modify the `.env` file to set your configurations. This file includes settings for each honeypot and the Elastic Stack.

2. **Start the Deployment**:
   Use the following command to start your honeypots:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
   ```

3. **Check Deployment Status**:
   Monitor the status of your pods:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

4. **Access Logs**:
   To view logs for a specific honeypot, use:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs <pod-name>
   ```

## Monitoring with Elastic Stack

The Elastic Stack provides powerful tools for monitoring and visualizing your honeypot data.

### Setting Up Elasticsearch and Kibana

1. **Deploy Elasticsearch**:
   Ensure Elasticsearch is running in your Kubernetes cluster. You can check its status with:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n elastic-system
   ```

2. **Deploy Kibana**:
   Deploy Kibana using:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/kibana.yaml
   ```

3. **Access Kibana**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://<your-kibana-url>:5601`. You will be greeted by the Kibana interface.

### Visualizing Honeypot Data

1. **Create Index Patterns**:
   In Kibana, create index patterns for your honeypot logs. This allows you to visualize the data collected.

2. **Build Dashboards**:
   Use Kibana‚Äôs dashboard features to create visual representations of the data. This can help identify patterns and anomalies.
